# ðŸš— EV Insights: Electric Vehicle Data Analysis and Dashboard

## 1. Introduction
The global transition towards sustainable energy has fueled the rapid adoption of **electric vehicles (EVs)**. With increasing concerns about carbon emissions and fuel efficiency, understanding EV market trends is critical for policymakers, manufacturers, and researchers.

This project involves building a data-driven system that integrates EV population data, performs **SQL-based analysis**, and presents insights through a **visual dashboard**. The project demonstrates how structured data analysis can provide actionable intelligence on EV adoption, performance, and growth patterns.

## 2. Objectives
The main objectives of this project are to:
- Organize and store EV population data in a relational database for structured analysis.  
- Identify adoption trends across different manufacturers and models.  
- Compare the distribution of **BEVs (Battery Electric Vehicles)** and **PHEVs (Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles)**.  
- Analyze technological progress by tracking maximum electric range across vehicle models.  
- Visualize insights through an interactive dashboard for easier interpretation and decision-making.

## 3. Methodology

### 3.1 Data Source
Dataset: *Electric Vehicle Population Data* (CSV format).  

Records include attributes such as:
- Vehicle Identification Number (VIN)  
- County, City, State  
- Model Year, Make, Model  
- Electric Vehicle Type (BEV/PHEV)  
- Electric Range (miles)  
- MSRP (base price)  
- CAFV (Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle) eligibility  
- Utility provider and Census tract

### 3.2 Data Storage
- A table named `ev_population` was created in **PostgreSQL**.  
- The dataset was ingested into the database.  
- Schema design ensured fields for vehicle type, range, and location to enable comprehensive queries.  

---

### 3.3 Data Analysis
SQL queries were designed to extract key insights:
- **Top 10 Manufacturers** by EV population  
- **BEV vs PHEV Distribution**, showing adoption patterns  
- **EV Adoption Over Time**, measured by model year growth  
- **Top 10 Models by Maximum Electric Range**, showcasing advancements in EV technology

### 3.4 Dashboard Development
The analyzed data was visualized in a dashboard to provide a clear representation of findings:
- ðŸ“Š **Bar Chart**: Top 10 EV makes (Tesla leads with ~68,983 registrations)  
- ðŸ¥§ **Pie Chart**: BEV (77.62%) vs PHEV (22.38%) share  
- ðŸ“ˆ **Line Chart**: EV population growth from 1996 to 2024  
- ðŸ“Š **Bar Chart**: Top models by maximum electric range (Tesla S, 3, X, Y, Chevrolet Bolt EV, Hyundai Kona, etc.)
